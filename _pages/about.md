Thanks for dropping by. I hope that it will not waste your time, but in case it does, at least I tried. My name is D. K. Bhargav Achary. Most just call me "Bhargav". I am originally from Berhampur, a small city, a business hub, in the southern part of Odisha, which is in the southern east of India. Being a Telugu by birth, an Odia by identity and an Indian by citizenship, I get a life with really cool dynamics.

To a great extent, I live the life of a <strike>computer geek</strike> techie, but I also do enjoy cricket, badminton, bicycling, music, gaming, traveling and a lot more. Do follow me on <a href="https://instagram.com/bhargav_achary/" target="_blank">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/bhargav_achary/" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+BhargavAchary" target="_blank">Google+</a> and like my <a href="https://facebook.com/BhargavAchary.github.io" target="_blank">Facebook page</a> for all my updates.
