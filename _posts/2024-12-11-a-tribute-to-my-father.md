True character often shines brightest when we pause to reflect on the people who shaped us. My father, Late Shri. Dandapati Jagannath Achary, whom I lovingly call Nana (owing to my Telugu origins), was that guiding light in my life. He was more than a parent; he was the cornerstone of who I am today. His life embodied resilience, selflessness, and unwavering love.

As I remember him, I’m inspired not just by personal memories but by the idea that ordinary individuals can leave extraordinary legacies. This tribute isn’t just for me; it’s for anyone seeking reassurance that kindness, sacrifice, and moral courage still thrive in this world. Nana’s story proves that true greatness doesn’t depend on wealth, status, or public recognition. Instead, it emerges through the quiet impact we have on others—an impact that echoes long after we are gone.

## **Humble Beginnings: Strength Forged Through Struggle**

Nana’s journey began in hardship. My grandparents faced severe financial constraints, making even basic education for their children a challenge. My grandfather, though a charismatic personality and the king’s goldsmith, fell into drinking and other lavish habits early in his life, leaving his children to fend for themselves. In such circumstances, while others might have faltered, Nana refused to give up. When he needed money for board exams, he sold his only bicycle. At times, he cooked and did chores for his teachers just to pay school fees. These teachers, recognizing his potential and determination, guided him with opportunities that became stepping stones to success.

Despite these challenges, Nana became a math champion. While many students spent hours studying, he was often occupied with chores—cooking, cleaning, and helping his family. Yet, he consistently excelled, often topping his class and scoring full marks. He instilled this love for math in me too, encouraging me to solve hundreds of problems in exchange for firecrackers during the Deepawali season.

Friends shared books, offered encouragement, and sometimes even split meals with him. These small acts of kindness created a ripple effect, allowing Nana to remain focused on his studies and instilling in him a deep appreciation for community and cooperation. Later in life, he extended the same generosity to his students. He treated them as his own children, spending on their needs without hesitation or record. His school became his second home, cared for with the same devotion as his family.

## **A Life in Education: Guiding Young Minds**

For 33 of the first 55 years of his life, when he was physically active and unaffected by paralysis, Nana dedicated himself wholeheartedly to teaching. He influenced countless children during a pivotal stage of their growth, leaving a profound impact that would shape their futures.

He taught a range of subjects—particularly passionate about mathematics and English—and embraced the mischievous curiosity of 4- to 10-year-olds with patience, humor, and warmth. While others might have seen rambunctious young minds as a challenge, Nana saw boundless potential. He believed that education wasn’t limited to academics; it was a chance to shape character, nurture confidence, and inspire big dreams. Over the course of his career, he touched at least a thousand lives, ensuring his legacy would endure in the hearts of those he taught.

## **The Rock-Steady Family Man**

Nana was the eldest son in his family, and as the only person with a stable and sustained income, he bore the responsibility of his family wholeheartedly. He was a rock of stability in his post-student life, dedicating his first two decades of personal life after joining the teaching service to his family. His sacrifices were exceptional, going far beyond what one could expect. He prioritized the well-being and needs of others, ensuring his siblings, parents, and extended family had the support they needed. These acts of selflessness touched deep emotions in those around him. While I choose not to discuss every detail out of respect for those close to him, it is undeniable that his actions defined what it means to be a true family man.

## **A True Partnership: The Role of Amma**

Nana’s achievements didn’t unfold in isolation. His journey was enriched, and often sustained, by the strength and resilience of my mother—Amma. Life tested them both, sometimes severely, but through every hardship, she stood by him, steadfast and loving.

Amma faced her own challenges, which made their life together far from easygoing. Yet, she was the constant support system Nana needed. From managing family responsibilities to caring for him during his most vulnerable years, Amma’s unwavering commitment defined their partnership.

In his final years, her care and dedication were nothing short of heroic. She navigated the difficulties of his declining health with patience and love, ensuring his comfort and dignity. Together, they formed a quiet, compassionate alliance that exemplified the very values Nana taught in his classroom—kindness, patience, and the power of steadfast commitment.

## **The Artistic Soul: A Love for Music and Cinema**

Beyond his role as a teacher and father, Nana was a man with an artistic soul. He was deeply inspired by the cinema of Raj Kapoor and became an ardent fan of Mukesh’s soulful voice. His passion for their work was so intense that he spent years saving up to buy a cassette player and collect their music. Owning a cassette player was a dream he nurtured for more than five years, skipping meals and undertaking countless cycle trips until he could finally afford it.

Listening to these cassettes brought him immense joy and solace. They became his sanctuary—a way to connect with life’s beauty and simplicity. This passion wasn’t just about entertainment; it reflected his values of love, humanity, and grace.

## **The Second Innings: A Battle Against All Odds**

My last memories of Nana are some of the most vivid and painful. On January 14, 2020, at around 1:30 pm, I received a call from his assistant teacher. He informed me that Nana had fallen off his chair, possibly suffering a stroke. When the phone was handed to Nana, he uttered in a blurry voice, “Bhargav, come soon,” and that was the last coherent conversation I had with him.

When I arrived, Nana was in the ICU. Over the weeks that followed, we celebrated even the smallest victories, such as when he managed to take his first spoon of semi-liquid food. However, life changed irreversibly. My mother sank into psychotic depression, and I took on every role imaginable—nurse, dietician, physiotherapist, and caretaker—all amidst the chaos of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In the first week of October 2024, I visited my parents after taking a break from my professional journey, a pause necessitated by multiple challenging circumstances. During this visit, I told my mother that I would bring them to Bengaluru, as I could no longer bear to see Nana in such a fragile state. Unfortunately, before I could fulfill this promise, Nana left us. He chose to spend his final moments in the home he had built after decades of hard work and struggle—a place he cherished deeply and where he found his peace.

## **A Void That Cannot Be Filled**

In the aftermath of his passing, I find myself grappling with a void that words cannot fully capture. I long for his reassuring hand on my shoulder and the warmth of his presence. The world feels quieter and emptier without him.

Yet, alongside the sorrow, there’s a deep gratitude for the legacy he left behind. His life’s work—his kindness, humor, and unwavering dedication to others—is now a guidepost lighting my path forward. While I can’t bring him back, I can honor his memory by living the values he instilled in me and continuing the cycle of support and compassion he started.

I miss you, Nana. I’ve missed your hand on my shoulder for a long time now, and now I can’t even feel your warmth. I miss your presence, your laughter, your wisdom. The loss is something I carry every day, but so is your legacy.

## **Moving Forward: Lessons of Endurance**

Though I cannot change what has happened, I can shape how I move forward. Nana’s spirit lives on in every kind act, every patient moment, every decision to uplift rather than tear down. His life was a testament to the strength and beauty of the human spirit, and for that, I will forever remain grateful.

Let's keep making progress!
Jai Jagannath, Hari Om!
