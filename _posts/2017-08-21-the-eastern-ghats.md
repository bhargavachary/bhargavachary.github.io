I am a Traveler, an Adventurer, a Nature Lover. These traits or so called interests, somehow lead me into exploration. After roaming across a number of beautiful, historical, naturally astounding places around the country in the recent years, I just took a break, and to a great extent this break happened as a set of situations, than a non-execution. I still traveled, but that was just mechanical, Hyderabad to Berhampur and vice-versa. Well, in the recent months, this break has been terminated, and I am back in form.

Last to last week, I just had a great bike trip along the eastern ghats of South Odisha. It was just awesome, 2 bikes, 4 friends and the eastern ghats, a total of 300+ kilometers of ride. I had been dreaming of this ride since years. This was extra-special, I spent my entire childhood and early adulthood at this place, yet it had not happened. A day, when I roamed around the hills just like that had never happened, don't know why. And, you know, it happens, exactly when it has to happen. You, simply can't do it, just because you want it. And, even if you end up doing it, you might just do it in the most unexpected ways. But, sweet, if you feel it. Finally it happened. And, eventually turned out to be one such extraordinary trip, I desperately waited for years and years. The timing was perfect, it was just about the mid of the rainy season. My depiction does have several proofs (pictures) of this wonderful timing, stay tuned.

We four, me, Trilochan (Amit), Duryodhan(Duri) and Baburao(Babu), started off after having an early heavy lunch instead of the breakfast in the morning. The trip I had in my mind was like this. First, we would go to a Buddist Monastery, called Padma Sambhava Maha Vihara (me and Amit were inherently in a spiritual exploration, where as Duri and Babu were more into the Adventure and Nature aspects). Second, we would enjoy the beauty of a nearby waterfall "Khasada". The Buddhist Monastery at Jeerango (Jiranga) is one of the biggest in South Asia, and Khasada is a locally popular and beautiful picnic spot, a small waterfall is there, surrounded with hills and woods. The idea of the trip was to spend some good time, have some great photographic moments in the journey, capture them in the naked eyes and network free minds. Just the mountains, the waterfalls, their sweet chip-chap sounds of waters, the ultra oxygenated air, and the ultimate greenery. For a nature lover like me, this is the ultimate bliss. I can live there until my last breathe.

We did not plan much on the trip, however, the route was considered in such a way that we go one way and return the other way round. So that, the exploration doubles up, the fun doubles up, ultimately the experiences double up. Me and Amit, had searched the location on Google Maps, and it showed up to be just about 100 kilometers if you go south from Berhampur for about 60 kilometers on the national highway and then take a right and enter into the hills via the state roads of Andhra and Odisha, it takes another 40 odd kilometers. We went ahead to the south, till Barua (a small town in Srikakulam, Andhra Pradesh) and then took right slowly heading onto the eastern ghats. 

The destination places were previously visited by me, however at tender ages. When, I had told my dad about the plan, a day before, he enquired with some people, and recommended a good and safe route to take. However, my craze on exploration was more and I thought we would return in that route that dad told, but we would go along the other route which Google Maps is suggesting. And, this instinct on Google Maps penalized us for some good. We landed up at a dead end, the route being closed uphill with our destination being shown on the other side of the hill. (Please refer the map snapshot for the route details.) We had, to change the route by talking to local people, taking their advices, no internet and no maps were to be trusted. That was already noon, and we had expected to reach the destination by 1p.m., this certainly seemed not happening to me. However, I said to my friends, come on guys, we explored these beautiful hills, that's our prize, don't worry we would lead a different route and reach the destination in an hour or so. Then we took the slightly lateral route via, Goppili Junction and then towards Chandragiri, but on the way we came across a board, which had "Gandahati" in Bold. Coincidentally, Amit had visited this place some years back. He said the road along leads to a nice waterfall called "Gandahati". I quickly suggestively questioned, "Shall we go? Is it worth?" He said, "it is a good one, big one". "And it's rainy season man, we must go", I replied by nodding my head, and called Babu and Duri back as they had gone slightly ahead. We took a U-turn, and quickly entered the way to a Heaven. 

It took about 10 mins (about 7 k.m.), deeper into the hills, the route was slightly tougher as it was under maintenance. The moment we reached there, we could listen to the wonderful blistering sounds of the falls. This was simply amazing. We were completely dumbstruck in the astonishing beauty of this magical place, the chilling water droplets in the air, it was Natural Air Conditioning. The beautiful rainbows being formed under the falls. The surrounding trees and the smell of the air. I am losing out on words to describe these experiences as, some experiences are not meant for reading or watching, they are only worth experiencing. However, I have posted a video, I firmly believe you would enjoy that. Our pain and rerouting had paid off. We intended to go to Jeerango (A Buddhist Monastery), and landed up in Gandahati (A beautiful Waterfall).  

After spending about an hour, I suggested to move along. It was more like a compulsion than a will. But, we wanted have to go to our destination, and not lose ourselves elsewhere. In our hearts, it was saying to stay back and just enjoy the waterfalls, take a bath and enjoy till it dawns. But, the determination or rigidity of thoughts, made us start off again. Everybody suppressed their feelings, and synced for reaching the planned destination. It was a small group, so making up the mind was not a big deal. Likeminded people in a group on an exploration, is bliss. This was sort of foolishness to be overconfident and heading onto a place as such, on an unknown route, without much research. But, we enjoyed this foolishness. Sometimes we don't need to be smart and intelligent. We just need to be ourselves.

We returned back to the main road towards Chandragiri, we continued towards Jiranga village. After about an hour of ride we reached the place, Google Maps was indicating that this is the village "Jiranga", and it was 3 p.m by then. But, my memory was not connecting somehow, and I failed to recognize this place. But, we went ahead and saw a school in the entrance of the village, and Jiranga was mentioned there. This gave us a shy of relief. Then we tried locating the Buddhist Monastery just by roaming around, and could not find it. After a few minutes, we talked to the villagers, I asked in Odia, "Bhaina, eita Jiranga aka na? Mandira ta kouthi?" - "Brother, this is Jiranga right?  Where's the temple?" A villager responded, "Maa nka mandira ta na, epate jao." - "Maa's temple right, follow this way." I said, "Na na, Maa nka nuhan, Buddha Mandira ta katha pocharuchi." - "No no, not maa's temple, I am asking about the Buddha Temple." He responded with a smiling face, "Tame bhul Jiranga ku asijaicha, seita ta Chandragiri Jeerango, aau tame asicha Ramagiri Jiranga." -  "You have arrived at the wrong Jiranga, that one is Chandragiri Jeerango and you have arrived at Ramagiri Jiranga." This was a bang on us. Our faces suddenly turned yellow. Even after so much of it, we did not reach there. The thing that was most irritating was, we planned to reach there by 1 pm, it was already 3pm, and we were still far from it. We were all hungry and tired by then. When do we reach there, and when do we start the spiritual/natural exploration of the place, this left us bugging. 

We did not have much options left for food, as it was too late, none of the rare hotels were open in any of the villages that used come after a considerable distance. We quickly asked, how do we reach the other Jeerango, and how far is it? How are the roads? All at a sudden these factors seemed very critical. The Eastern Ghats are historically considered not so safe after dawn, due to various reasons. Maoists have had a not so great history in this area, the wildness of the jungles, the availability of no mobile network. All these issues could become big, if we got into any trouble. If a bike fails, we are gone. It might rain as well. With all these thoughts in the background, the main thought was of the return to home. We had an option to proceed forward or return back through the route we went, but both had the same distance (of 150 kilometers either ways) according to maps and the local people. We had to quickly decide on it. On one hand, we knew the path we came through (we could return this way safely), and on the other hand, we didn't know where exactly we were leading to (but, we could still find our destination and then get home). We had some thoughts of negativity, because of the tiredness. It was almost 150 kilometers of ride by then, though the Ghats, the roads were tough and getting exhausted was easy. We took 5 minutes to decide what to do, and finally made up our minds, to go ahead and not back the same way. Meanwhile, the petrol was exhausting in our bikes, we had to refill it as well. We enquired about the onward path, and people optimistically told that there is a filling station ahead and also we would reach the actual Jeerango some kilometers after that. And, meanwhile at a village (if I recollect the name properly, it was Sundorabo), we had some snacks "Aloo Bonda and Besan Pakudi". This was the much needed energy booster, and hunger killer. Before that we had taken a small break at another smaller village and gotten hold of some biscuits and water, but that had not helped much.

Finally at about 5 p.m. we reached Jeerango, this time the actual and intended Jeerango and also found the route to the Monastery. It seemed we had entered a different country altogether. The Tibetans have a very different lifestyle as compared to the typical Indian one. The structure of the houses were different in the village. There were so many varieties of dogs in the streets. The people looked different, they looked Tibetan. :D Though, my friends Duri and Babu, do not understand much of the difference and call them Chinese. There was still one small fear, that whether we would get an entry into the Monastery or not. But, we had taken so much of it, God could not be so cruel. We got an entry. Me and Amit were trying to learn about Buddha and Duri and Babu were seeing what a different world it is, with these Red/maroon wearing priest like people, The Monks. The campus was beautifully maintained. It was almost 6, by the time we almost completely explored the campus. 

It was already too late and from there it was still about 120 kilometers to reach our homes, we had to skip "Khasada", and come back as soon as possible. We drove fairly well, even in the tiring evening, we had to reach back home safe and early and show our faces to our parents. They would already be expecting us much earlier, this thought was coming more and more the closer we were getting to our homes. As we had mobile network back, we had informed that we would reach a bit late, probably at about 6-7 in the evening. However, we reached by 8 p.m. to our homes safe, eventually. Though, we all ended up tired, in great pains, we still were happy and joyous, even at the very end of the day. While, saying bye to the day, Duri was still a bit disappointed at me as I had informed him that we would return by 3-4 p.m. before evening. So he had possibly made some other commitments for the evening. He is a simple and a non-tech guy and making him understand all these aspects was difficult, how Google maps tuned out to be. However, I just told him, I did not do it on purpose and said sorry, he said, "Dooston mein ye sab chalta re...", and you need not be sorry.

I know it's not the same experience for all, but I leave you with some snaps and moments from our story.

Thank you so much for your kind reading. I would love to hear from you in the comments section below.
And yeah, Bhargav is back.


Trivia: 

1. The bikes consumed about 8 liters of petrol each.
2. We covered the Ghats of about 150 k.m. in a duration of 6 hours, taking breaks, photos, enjoying the greenery and air.
3. We had decent body pains for the next couple of days, and kept remembering these moments. (The roads were certainly tough in our onward journey, but the return was smooth.)
4. Baburao joined us in the very last moment for the trip, and he enjoyed a lot with this being a complete surprise package.
