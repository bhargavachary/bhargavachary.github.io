It’s quite obvious to encounter questions from people about things they don’t know much about! And this is why I often face questions like, “How is Odisha?”, “What’s its culture like?”, “What’s special there?” and so on. These questions triggered me to write this post—Odisha: The Land Slightly Unknown! If you’re curious to know about my state, go on. I promise you’ll find it interesting as we explore this wonderful state and its people.

## Geography and Demographics

Currently, India has 29 states and 7 union territories, and Odisha is one of the states in eastern India. With an area of about 155,000 square kilometers (the 9th largest in India), Odisha is home to a decent 4.5 crore people (approx). The state is surrounded by West Bengal to the northeast, Jharkhand to the north, Chhattisgarh to the west, and Andhra Pradesh to the south.

Odisha has 485 kilometers (301 miles) of coastline along the Bay of Bengal, stretching from Balasore in the north to Ganjam in the south. Bhubaneswar, the state capital, is one of modern India’s first planned cities, alongside Jamshedpur and Chandigarh. Bhubaneswar itself has over a thousand temples, earning it the title of the “Temple City of India.” Odisha’s 30 districts are a blend of diverse lifestyles, dialects, and landscapes, giving the state its unique charm. It’s also one of India’s largest producers of electricity and steel.

## A Culture Called "Odia"

Odisha is all about a vibrant culture called **"Odia."** And yes, don’t get confused—it’s simple! The language, the culture, and the people of Odisha are all lovingly referred to by the same word: **Odia**.

## Utkala and Its Meaning

Odisha carries forward its ancient and glorious history as **“Utkala.”** Sounds familiar, right? Yes, it’s the same word mentioned in India’s national anthem. Utkala is one of Odisha’s former names, along with “Kalinga” and “Udra Desha.”

### What’s the meaning of "Utkala"?

> "उत्कृष्ट कलायाः देशः यः सः उत्कलः"  
> (The land that excels in art is called Utkala. "Kala" means art, and "Utkrishta" means excellent.)

Isn’t that beautiful? You can see this artistic excellence everywhere in Odisha—Odissi dance, Pattachitra paintings, Sambalpuri sarees, and even the famous sand art of Puri!

## Festivals Galore

There’s an Odia proverb, “bara mase tera parba,” which means "thirteen festivals in twelve months." This is so true for Odisha! Here are some highlights:

- **Rath Yatra:** The iconic chariot festival of Lord Jagannath.
- **Raja Sankranti:** A unique celebration of womanhood, full of fun and feasting.
- **Kartika Month:** The holiest month of the year, during which many people go vegetarian.
- **Manabasa Gurubara:** A month-long festivity dedicated to Maa Lakshmi.

Even during "Kartika Panchuka" (the five holiest days), there’s a traditional belief that even birds like cranes and spoonbills fast. Fascinating, isn’t it?

## Food in Odisha

Food in Odisha? Oh, it’s simple yet magical! The minimal use of spices keeps it both tasty and healthy. Rice is the hero of most meals, accompanied by dishes like **Dalama**, **Santula**, **Besara**, and **Ghanta Tarkari**.  

And who can forget the iconic **Jhal Mudi**—our spiced puffed rice that you’ll find everywhere from street corners to train stations?

### Sweet Delights

Odia sweets are pure bliss. Here are a few you can’t miss:

- **Rasagola:** Yes, it originated here in Odisha!
- **Chhena Poda:** A baked dessert made from fresh chhena (cottage cheese).
- **Kakara:** Sweet fritters with coconut filling.
- **Arisa:** A delightful rice flour pancake sweetened with jaggery.

## Odisha’s Resilience

Odisha is a land where nature and life coexist beautifully. Though the state often faces cyclones due to its geographic location, its people remain resilient. Their strength and determination shine through every challenge.

## Notable Odias

Odisha has given the world many remarkable personalities, including:

- **Subhas Chandra Bose:** Born in Cuttack, he was one of India’s greatest freedom fighters.
- **V.V. Giri:** The 4th President of India, born in Berhampur.
- **Alan Turing:** Surprised? His parents were stationed in the Bihar-Odisha region when he was conceived!

## Wrapping Up

Well, this was just a curtain-raiser about Odisha. As they say, “Picture abhi baaki hai, mere dost!” I’ll come back with more magical stories about my state in a sequel post soon.
