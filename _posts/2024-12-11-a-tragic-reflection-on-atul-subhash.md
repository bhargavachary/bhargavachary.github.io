The tragic death of Atul Subhash—a Bengaluru-based professional who succumbed to the pressures of alleged harassment, legal battles, and chronic stress—forces us to confront uncomfortable truths about our society, legal systems, and mental health awareness. His story is not just a singular tragedy; it is emblematic of the struggles faced by countless individuals across the country. It reminds us of the need for a collective reckoning—a shift in how we view mental health, equity, and the essence of living a purposeful life.

## **The Story of Atul Subhash: A Life Unraveled**

Atul Subhash, a Deputy General Manager at an automobile firm in Bengaluru, was by all accounts a successful professional. However, behind the facade of achievement lay years of silent suffering. His ordeal began in 2020 when his wife filed multiple legal cases against him, including under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code—a law designed to protect women from cruelty.

Over the next four years, Atul made nearly 40 trips to courts in Jaunpur, Uttar Pradesh, traveling thousands of kilometers while juggling work and personal obligations. His 24-page suicide note and 80-minute video detail the harassment he endured, including allegations of extortion by his in-laws, who demanded ₹3 crore to withdraw cases and ₹30 lakh for visitation rights to his son.

His brother described Atul as “mentally and physically exhausted” by the relentless litigation and societal humiliation. In the end, Atul quietly left this world, leaving behind questions, grief, and a call for societal introspection.

## **A Broader Crisis: Beyond Atul’s Story**

Atul’s tragedy is not an isolated incident. It is part of a larger tapestry of despair that engulfs many in India. From IIT students overwhelmed by academic pressure to professionals crushed by corporate demands, the struggles are diverse but share common threads of societal neglect and systemic inefficiencies.

### **1. Legal System Failures**
- While laws like Section 498A are critical for protecting women, they can also be misused. Atul’s case highlights how legal tools can sometimes become weapons in personal disputes.
- The judicial backlog exacerbates the problem. Over 40 million cases are pending in Indian courts, with family disputes often dragging on for years, causing emotional and financial exhaustion for all involved.

### **2. Mental Health Neglect**
- India faces a mental health crisis, with over 139,000 suicides reported annually. Despite this, the country has only one psychiatrist for every 100,000 people, far below the WHO-recommended ratio.
- The stigma surrounding mental health discourages individuals from seeking help, and those who do often find resources scarce or inaccessible.

### **3. Societal Pressures and Toxic Relationships**
- Atul’s story underscores how societal norms can trap individuals in toxic relationships, fueled by expectations, shame, and a lack of support systems.
- Chronic stress, fueled by harassment or unyielding societal pressures, often goes unnoticed until it is too late.

## **Radical Alternatives to Despair**

For those facing unbearable circumstances, the concept of *agyaatvas*—retreating from one’s current life to find renewal—offers a unique cultural solution. Inspired by Indian epics, agyaatvas is not about escapism but about stepping away to rediscover purpose and peace.

### **How Agyaatvas Could Help:**
- **Rebuild in Solitude:** Leaving toxic environments behind allows individuals to reflect and heal. Whether it’s a remote village in Arunachal Pradesh or a new community, the change in scenery can be transformative.
- **Purposeful Living:** Engaging in meaningful work, such as teaching or serving marginalized communities, shifts focus from personal pain to societal contribution.

While agyaatvas may not be practical for everyone, the underlying principle of finding purpose and disconnecting from toxicity remains powerful. For others, purposeful living in familiar settings—like volunteering at an orphanage or engaging in local community projects—can provide similar relief.

## **Living Purposefully: A Call to Action**

Atul’s story calls for us to consider alternatives to despair, emphasizing that life’s purpose extends beyond personal struggles. Some potential pathways include:
- **Teaching Values to Future Generations:** Working with children, especially in underserved areas, to impart skills and values can bring deep fulfillment.
- **Volunteering for Causes:** Serving communities in need, whether through disaster relief, healthcare, or education, provides a sense of contribution and self-worth.
- **Rejecting Toxicity:** Moving away from harmful relationships and situations is not cowardice—it is self-preservation.

## **Systemic and Social Reforms: Building a Kinder Society**

### **1. Mental Health Advocacy**
- Normalize conversations around mental health through national campaigns, storytelling sessions, and open dialogues.
- Train general physicians in basic mental health care to bridge the resource gap and ensure universal insurance coverage for psychiatric treatments.

### **2. Judicial Reforms**
- Establish mediation cells to resolve family disputes more amicably and swiftly.
- Implement checks to prevent misuse of protective laws without diluting their intent.

### **3. Community Support Systems**
- Create safe spaces for individuals to share their struggles without fear of judgment, whether through local workshops or online forums.
- Encourage workplaces to offer sabbaticals or structured volunteering programs for employees facing personal crises.

## **Hope Over Despair: A Final Reflection**

Atul Subhash’s death is a stark reminder of the price we pay for neglecting mental health, equity, and empathy. Yet, his story also carries a message of hope. To those feeling overwhelmed, let this serve as a reminder: there are always alternatives to despair. Life is not about the absence of struggle but about finding strength and purpose amidst adversity.

To anyone considering suicide: take a pause. Step away from toxic environments, seek out supportive individuals, and explore avenues to live a purposeful life. Whether it’s teaching, volunteering, or starting afresh in an unfamiliar setting, renewal is possible.

As a society, we must build systems that value human dignity, equity, and kindness. Together, let’s ensure no one feels so cornered that ending their life seems the only way out.
