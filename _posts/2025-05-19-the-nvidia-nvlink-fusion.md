excerpt: "As the AI and HPC revolution accelerates, memory bottlenecks have become one of the greatest obstacles to performance scaling. Traditional CPU–GPU architectures—limited by PCIe interconnects and fragmented memory domains—struggle to keep pace with the bandwidth and coherency demands of trillion-parameter LLMs and petascale simulations. With **NVLink Fusion**, announced at **Computex 2025**, NVIDIA has introduced a paradigm shift. It blends high-bandwidth NVLink and CPU memory coherency into a unified memory fabric, enabling CPUs (both Grace ARM and x86) to share GPU memory directly—without the need for DMA copying or PCIe translation overheads. This blog post unpacks NVLink Fusion’s architecture, design goals, performance benefits, ecosystem collaborations, and how it competes with AMD Infinity Fabric and Apple’s UMA in the high-stakes landscape of heterogeneous computing."

As the AI and HPC revolution accelerates, memory bottlenecks have become one of the greatest obstacles to performance scaling. Traditional CPU–GPU architectures—limited by PCIe interconnects and fragmented memory domains—struggle to keep pace with the bandwidth and coherency demands of trillion-parameter LLMs and petascale simulations. With **NVLink Fusion**, announced at **Computex 2025**, NVIDIA has introduced a paradigm shift. It blends high-bandwidth NVLink and CPU memory coherency into a unified memory fabric, enabling CPUs (both Grace ARM and x86) to share GPU memory directly—without the need for DMA copying or PCIe translation overheads. This blog post unpacks NVLink Fusion’s architecture, design goals, performance benefits, ecosystem collaborations, and how it competes with AMD Infinity Fabric and Apple’s UMA in the high-stakes landscape of heterogeneous computing.

## 1. The Bottleneck No One Could Ignore: CPU-GPU Memory Access

### 1.1 Memory Wall in AI & HPC

Large-scale workloads—like Large Language Models (LLMs), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and scientific simulations—demand immense compute resources across heterogeneous CPUs and GPUs. However, **memory bandwidth and coherency between these processors** has historically been a limiting factor.

- **PCIe bottlenecks** cap data transfer rates between CPU and GPU at ~128–256 GB/s.
- Traditional CPU–GPU systems require **redundant memory copies**, adding latency and consuming extra DRAM capacity.
- AI model training suffers as **model weights, gradients, and activations are scattered across memory pools**.

### 1.2 NVLink's Journey: From Pascal to Blackwell

- **NVLink v1 (Pascal, 2016)**: Introduced fast GPU-GPU links.
- **Ampere & Hopper**: Expanded to multi-GPU clusters, but CPU–GPU remained PCIe-bound in x86 systems.
- **Grace Hopper Superchips (2022–2023)**: Introduced NVLink-C2C within ARM-based Grace-Hopper nodes.

### 2.3 How NVLink Fusion Works: The Technical Core

#### 1. Unified Coherent Memory Fabric

- **Cache coherency** is maintained across CPU caches, GPU L2, and HBM stacks.
- CPU and GPU operate on the **same memory blocks** simultaneously.

> **Analogy**: Imagine your whole team working on a live shared document instead of emailing versions. That’s NVLink Fusion.

#### 2. NVSwitch with Coherency Routing

- Enhanced **NUMA-aware fabric routing**.
- Maintains **ownership and cache states** across CPUs and GPUs.

#### 3. CPU-Agnostic Support

- Through **protocol adapters**, x86 CPUs can coherently access GPU memory.
- A major step toward **multi-vendor memory unification**.

#### 4. Smart Memory Management (NVMMU)

- Supports **on-the-fly memory migration** and **multi-device sharing**.
- Integrated with CUDA, NCCL, and NVSHMEM stacks.
