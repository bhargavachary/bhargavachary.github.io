Today I want to share a concerning observation that has been deeply troubling me. Living in Bangalore, a city known for its vibrant culture and thriving tech industry, I've come to appreciate its unique blend of tradition and modernity. However, recent incidents have left me disheartened and questioning the values of the community we are building here.

#### A Disturbing Incident

Just a few days ago, I witnessed an incident that encapsulates a growing issue. A local taxi driver became violently aggressive towards a young tech professional over a minor misunderstanding. The situation quickly escalated, with the driver physically attacking the techie all because the latter couldn't communicate in Kannada. This scene unfolded before my eyes and it was a harsh reminder of the intolerance that is festering within certain segments of our society.

#### The Bigger Picture

This incident is not an isolated one. Day after day, I see similar behaviors from auto drivers, shopkeepers, and others towards those who are not fluent in Kannada. While I deeply respect and appreciate the love for the local language and culture, the aggression and lack of civility towards non-Kannada speakers is alarming.

#### The Dilemma

As a migrant myself who has embraced Bangalore and its culture and has been trying to learn Kannada, this hostility makes me question my future here. Moving away might shield my family and me from such encounters, but it doesn't address the root of the problem. We need to foster a more inclusive environment where diversity is celebrated and everyone feels safe and respected.

#### A Call for Change

I am reaching out to my personal and professional network to share this story and initiate a conversation about how we can collectively address this issue. It's imperative that we:

- **Promote Awareness:** Educate locals about the contributions of the migrant community to the city's growth and prosperity.
- **Encourage Dialogue:** Create platforms where locals and migrants can interact and understand each other's perspectives.
- **Advocate for Policy Changes:** Work with local authorities to implement policies that protect all residents from discrimination and violence.
