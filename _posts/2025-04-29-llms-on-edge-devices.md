M-series, Snapdragon X Elite, AMD Phoenix, Intel Meteor Lake — the most powerful SoCs ever made for consumers. But even they struggle with running large language models locally. Here's why edge AI inference hits roadblocks, and what the future holds.

**How Apple, AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm hit the limits of on-device AI — and what it really takes to run LLMs locally**

## **1. From WWDC Hype to Edge AI Hope**

It was a Bengaluru morning like any other — clouds hanging low, the comforting aroma of filter coffee, and Apple’s WWDC streaming in the background. The phrase *Apple Intelligence* lit up the screen — a perfect blend of marketing brilliance and technical aspiration. I’ll admit, I leaned forward.

After a decade of debugging system bottlenecks and watching AI gradually seep from server racks into silicon, this felt like a moment. M-series chips. Unified memory. Local LLMs. It had finally arrived.

Or had it?

Few months later, the rose-tinted optimism had dulled. Siri hadn’t become any wiser, and the local LLMs felt more like college interns trying to impersonate a CEO. As I wrote in ["The Apple Intelligence Saga"](https://bhargavachary.in/2024/12/12/the-apple-intellgence-saga.html), the dream was real, but the execution struggled.

And that’s what this blog unpacks: not just **how the edge is promising**, but also **why it’s still disappointing**.

## **2. Meet the SoCs: Silicon Powerhouses, Paper Tigers**

Modern SoCs like Apple M-series, Snapdragon X Elite, AMD Phoenix, and Intel Meteor Lake are marvels: tightly integrated, multi-core, and packed with AI accelerators. But power doesn’t always mean practicality.

### 🍏 Apple M-Series

- **Strengths:** Unified memory, FP16 native, fast Metal backends  
- **Weaknesses:** RAM capped at 24 GB, thermal throttling, inconsistent runtime support

### ⚙️ Snapdragon X Elite

- **Strengths:** Promising dual NPU, ARM efficiency  
- **Weaknesses:** No real-world LLM benchmarks, unknown sustained throughput

### 🔥 AMD Phoenix / Strix

- **Strengths:** Good iGPU (RDNA3), XDNA NPU starting to emerge  
- **Weaknesses:** Software stack still catching up, limited kernel coverage

### ❄️ Intel Meteor Lake

- **Strengths:** First serious NPU in Intel PC chips, Arc GPU supports FP16  
- **Weaknesses:** Power-constrained, runtime immaturity

## **3. Why So Much Power Still Feels So Weak**

### 🧠 Memory Bandwidth Bottleneck

> *Pouring petrol through a straw won’t win a race.*

Even Apple’s M3 Pro at 150+ GB/s pales in comparison to data center GPUs like NVIDIA H100 (3 TB/s). LLMs are bandwidth-hungry monsters.

### ⚙️ Roofline Limits

Low arithmetic intensity in LLM layers means even 100 TOPS NPUs can sit idle — starving for data.

### 🔥 Thermal Throttling

Edge devices are built for bursts, not endurance. Sustained inference on a thin MacBook? Your tokens/sec graph will look like Bangalore traffic on a Monday morning.

## **4. Quantization: How Small Can You Go?**

Quantization is essential — but risky.

| **Format** | **Memory Use** | **Accuracy** | **Notes** |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|-----------|
| **FP16**  | 50% of FP32     | Near-lossless | Ideal if supported |
| **INT8**  | 25% of FP32     | Mild drop     | Needs calibration |
| **INT4**  | ~12.5%          | Noticeable loss | Use GPTQ or QLoRA |
| **INT3**  | ~9%             | High risk     | Often “robotic” responses |

> *From FLAC to MP3 to ringtone — there’s a breaking point.*

INT4 gets 7B models on 8 GB RAM, but coherence suffers without careful tuning.

---

## **5. Runtimes: The Invisible Bottleneck**

### ONNX Runtime

Portable, but lacks optimal kernels. Apple M1/M2 performance often slower than CPU fallback.

### Core ML / MLX

Fastest option on Apple — if you use `llama.cpp` with Metal. Avoid PyTorch on MPS unless you enjoy waiting.

### DirectML

A great idea (runs on all GPUs) but not yet optimized for LLMs. Coverage for complex ops remains limited.

## **6. Benchmarks: Expectation vs Reality**

| **Platform**            | **Tokens/sec (7B Q4/Q6)** |
|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| Apple M2                | 20–40 (`llama.cpp`)        |
| Intel Meteor Lake       | ~10–30 (DirectML, est.)    |
| AMD Phoenix             | ~20 (FP16, ONNX)           |
| Snapdragon X Elite      | TBD (claimed 13B support)  |

Apple leads due to software-hardware synergy. Others have potential, but runtime gaps hold them back.

---

## **7. Why 7B Isn’t Enough**

7B models don’t have the depth or nuance we expect from ChatGPT-level experiences — especially after quantization.

> *You don’t need GPT-4 for grocery lists. But don’t expect a 7B model to write your wedding vows.*

Until we get well-tuned 13B+ models on-device or hybrid cloud-edge solutions, quality will remain mid-tier.

---

## **8. Apple Intelligence: A Cautionary Tale**

Apple promised an on-device, contextual AI revolution.

What we got:

- 7B model playing dress-up  
- Siri delays till 2026  
- Limited creativity tools  
- Inconsistent device support

Even Apple hit the **glass ceiling**: limited RAM, thermal budget, and immature runtimes.

---

## **9. The Real Fix: Hardware + Software + Honesty**

We need:

- ✅ Higher memory bandwidth (>150 GB/s)  
- ✅ Better runtime kernels (FlashAttention, fused MLPs)  
- ✅ Smaller, smarter models (MoE, distillation, QLoRA)  
- ✅ Realistic expectations

Let’s stop calling 7B INT4 a “GPT-4 competitor.” It’s not. Not yet.

## **10. Parting Thoughts: Bengaluru’s AI Moment**

Edge AI feels a lot like Bengaluru’s road network: intelligent intentions, brilliant engineers, and… bottlenecks at every corner.

We’ve got great engines — M3 Max, X Elite, Phoenix — but our road (runtime maturity, bandwidth, quantization quality) is full of potholes.

> *“Kya karein, traffic toh hai.”* But that doesn’t mean we stop building.

There’s progress. Tools like `llama.cpp`, MLX, ONNX, and Core ML are improving. Next-gen chips (M4, Strix, Arrow Lake) will lift ceilings further.

And maybe, just maybe, the future of AI won’t live in cloud clusters — it’ll run right from your laptop bag.

While we just focused on LLMs for this article, we need to appreciate the fact that DNN-inference especially relevant to image, video, speech processing have progressed significantly and we cannot discard their significance just because the hardware is still *"Not LLM ready".*
