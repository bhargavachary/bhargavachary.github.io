In our society, physical disabilities like blindness or losing a limb are often more easily recognized and accommodated. But it's important to remember that neurodiversity-based challenges like ADHD, Autism, Dyslexia, Dyspraxia, OCD, and Bipolar Disorder are just as significant and impactful. These conditions can seriously affect someone's ability to function and thrive, even if you can't see it.

Many people mistakenly think that neurodiverse conditions are just psychological and can be overcome with a positive attitude alone. This misunderstanding misses the physiological basis of these conditions and the huge impact they have on daily life. Living with a neurodiverse condition can be incredibly challenging. Just like physical disabilities can limit mobility and independence, neurodiverse conditions can mess with cognitive processes, social interactions, and daily functioning.

Mental health is highly disregarded as an issue in India. We often think and keep spreading the idea that we need to be kind to those in need. We can help a beggar, we can help someone who is blind, and we can help someone who is deaf. But when it comes to helping a person going through depression, someone with autism who has difficulty expressing themselves, or someone with dyslexia who struggles with typical learning methods, we fall short.

Another big issue is the diagnosis and treatment of these challenges. Awareness and access to qualified doctors who can diagnose and treat neurodiverse conditions are limited, especially in countries like India. In a place where physical disabilities often don't get the attention they deserve, the situation for neurological challenges is even worse. The lack of awareness and resources makes it even harder for people dealing with these conditions.

I feel a deep sense of empathy for those dealing with these challenges. I'm not here to blame anyone but to highlight the urgent need for support and understanding. Having faced lots of challenges in my own life, I've learned the importance of empathy. While I can't say I completely understand what you're going through, I want you to know that I'm here for you. I can listen, support, and help in any way you need.

Let’s recognize that everyone’s struggles are valid and deserve support. By fostering a more inclusive and empathetic society, we can make sure that people with neurodiverse conditions get the understanding and accommodations they need to succeed. Together we can build a world where all forms of diversity are acknowledged, respected, and supported.
