Bhargav's Personal Blog â€” Repository

Quick note

This repository contains the source for the blog site. Important: do NOT build or run the site locally unless you are using an isolated, reproducible environment (Docker, GitHub Codespaces, or a sanctioned VM) and you understand the project's Ruby/Bundler and JS toolchain.

Why
- Local builds can modify generated files, cause environment drift, and lead to accidental commits or deployment failures.

If you need to preview changes
- Open a PR with your changes and request a preview build, or ask a maintainer for a temporary preview environment.

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for more details.

Note: This repository builds smoothly on GitHub Pages. Local builds can be fragile because they require exact Ruby/Bundler and plugin versions to match the Pages environment.
