## Automated Testing (Future)

### Unit Tests
```javascript
// Example tests to implement
describe('Search Functionality', () => {
  test('debounces search input', () => {});
  test('highlights matching terms', () => {});
  test('escapes HTML in results', () => {});
  test('handles empty query', () => {});
  test('limits results to max', () => {});
});
```

### E2E Tests
```javascript
// Example Playwright/Cypress tests
describe('Search E2E', () => {
  test('opens modal on button click', () => {});
  test('searches and displays results', () => {});
  test('navigates to post on result click', () => {});
  test('closes modal on escape', () => {});
});
```
